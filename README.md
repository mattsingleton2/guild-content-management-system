# guild-content-management-system
The Guild Content Management System -- a gaming community website! 

This is for our GCMS Portfolio Project and hopefully future money-making project as well! 

To start the project, I'm using lite-server. npm run will do the trick for you.

Please do not push directly to main. Before you begin coding, checkout a new branch with whatever you plan to work on and push that.
Create a pull request for me and we'll look at merging it in! 

Thanks for the teamwork. Let's knock this out and have some fun with it!
